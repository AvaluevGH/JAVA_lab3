Expanding the capabilities of the graphical user interface
Most GUI applications have an additional means of interaction with the user - the menu bar. The menu bar at the top of the application window contains the names of the items
drop-down menus. Clicking on the item name opens a menu containing menu items and submenus. When the user clicks on a menu item, all menus are closed and a message is sent to the program.
